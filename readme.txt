== Description ==
Oni daiko is the traditional masked dance-drama of Sado Island in Japan since it began 500 years ago. People in Sado Island used to play the dance-drama for exorcism, success in business, and good harvests.

Unfortunately there was no relation between this plugin Oni daiko and the traditional dance-drama. Instead it provides a function that shows a list of the latest posts from all blogs under your WordPress Multisite
Also it supports widgets and outputs RSS feeds.
